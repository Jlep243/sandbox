In this folder I have made a textbased game that I will be making in order to reinforce the fundamentals of python that I have learned so far. Things like 
functions, lists, if/else statements, and possibly dictionaries and input,output of functions.
Eventually the game will have combat and you're able to explore all these other parts of the city or village.
