"""In this section we go over Functions that we can build but there are also built in functions"""
#Like so -----> https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html

#all functions work the same. They all have a name and parentheses 
#like so --> print(), len(),

#We could also make our own function. 
#We start with def my_function_name():

def my_function():
    print("hello")
    print("bye")

#Though when we make a function. It will not run by its own. 
#We need to call the function like we do with print function or the length function

my_function()
